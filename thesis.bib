  Abstract =	 {A new global land cover database for the year 2000
                  (GLC2000) has been produced by an international
                  partnership of 30 research groups coordinated by the
                  European Commission's Joint Research Centre. The
                  database contains two levels of land cover
                  information—detailed, regionally optimized land
                  cover legends for each continent and a less
                  thematically detailed global legend that harmonizes
                  regional legends into one consistent product. The
                  land cover maps are all based on daily data from the
                  VEGETATION sensor on-board SPOT 4, though mapping of
                  some regions involved use of data from other Earth
                  observing sensors to resolve specific
                  issues. Detailed legend definition, image
                  classification and map quality assurance were
                  carried out region by region. The global product was
                  made through aggregation of these. The database is
                  designed to serve users from science programmes,
                  policy makers, environmental convention
                  secretariats, non-governmental organizations and
                  development-aid projects. The regional and global
                  data are available free of charge for all non-

                  calculate country-by-country rainfed area statistics
                  using remote sensing data. A suite of spatial
                  datasets, methods and protocols for mapping GMRCA
                  were described. These consist of: (a) data fusion
                  and composition of multi-resolution time-series
                  mega-file data-cube (MFDC), (b) image segmentation
                  based on precipitation, temperature, and elevation
                  zones, (c) spectral correlation similarity (SCS),
                  (d) protocols for class identification and labeling
                  through uses of SCS R2-values, bi-spectral plots,
                  space-time spiral curves (ST-SCs), rich source of
                  field-plot data, and zoom-in-views of Google Earth
                  (GE), and (e) techniques for resolving mixed classes
                  by decision tree algorithms, and spatial
                  modeling. The outcome was a 9-class GMRCA from which
                  country-by-country rainfed area statistics were
                  computed for the end of the last millennium. The
                  global rainfed cropland area estimate from the GMRCA
                  9-class map was 1.13†billion hectares (Bha). The
                  total global cropland areas (rainfed plus irrigated)
                  was 1.53†Bha which was close to national statistics
                  compiled by FAOSTAT (1.51†Bha). The accuracies and
                  errors of GMRCA were assessed using field-plot and
                  Google Earth data points. The accuracy varied
                  between 92 and 98% with kappa value of about 0.76,
                  errors of omission of 2-8%, and the errors of
                  commission of 19-36%."

@article{Friedl2002,
  abstract =     {Until recently, advanced very high-resolution
                  radiometer (AVHRR) observations were the only viable
                  source of data for global land cover mapping. While
                  many useful insights have been gained from analyses
                  based on AVHRR data, the availability of moderate
                  resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) data
                  with greatly improved spectral, spatial, geometric,
                  and radiometric attributes provides significant new
                  opportunities and challenges for remote
                  sensing-based land cover mapping research. In this
                  paper, we describe the algorithms and databases
                  being used to produce the MODIS global land cover
                  product. This product provides maps of global land
                  cover at 1-km spatial resolution using several
                  classification systems, principally that of the
                  IGBP. To generate these maps, a supervised
                  classification methodology is used that exploits a
                  global database of training sites interpreted from
                  high-resolution imagery in association with
                  ancillary data. In addition to the IGBP class at
                  each pixel, the MODIS land cover product provides
                  several other parameters including estimates for the
                  classification confidence associated with the IGBP
                  label, a prediction for the most likely alternative
                  class, and class labels for several other
                  classification schemes that are used by the global
                  modeling community. Initial results based on 5
                  months of MODIS data are encouraging. At global
                  scales, the distribution of vegetation and land
                  cover types is qualitatively realistic. At regional
                  scales, comparisons among heritage AVHRR products,
                  Landsat TM data, and results from MODIS show that
                  the algorithm is performing well. As a longer time
                  series of data is added to the processing stream and
                  the representation of global land cover in the site
                  database is refined, the quality of the MODIS land
                  cover product will improve accordingly.},

  abstract =     {It is important, if not essential, to integrate the
                  computations and code used in data analyses,
                  methodological descriptions, simulations, and so on
                  with the documents that describe and rely on
                  them. This integration allows readers to both verify
                  and adapt the claims in the documents. Authors can
                  easily reproduce the results in the future, and they
                  can present the document’s contents in a different
                  medium, for example, with interactive controls. This
                  article describes a software framework for both
                  authoring and distributing these integrated, dynamic
                  documents that contain text, code, data, and any
                  auxiliary content needed to recreate the
                  computations. The documents are dynamic in that the
                  contents—including ﬁgures, tables, and so on—can be
                  recalculated each time a view of the document is
                  generated. Our model treats a dynamic document as a
                  master or “source” document from which one can
                  generate different views in the form of traditional,
                  derived documents for different audiences. We
                  introduce the concept of a compendium as a container
                  for one or more dynamic documents and the different
                  elements needed when processing them, such as code
                  and data. The compendium serves as a means for
                  distributing, managing, and updating the
                  collection. The step from disseminating analyses via
                  a compendium to reproducible research is a small
                  one. By reproducible research, we mean research
                  papers with accompanying software tools that allow
                  the reader to directly reproduce the results and
                  employ the computational methods that are presented
                  in the research paper. Some of the issues involved
                  in paradigms for the production, distribution, and

                  provide consistent land cover for all 50 States, and

                  a 30 m Digital Elevation Model (DEM) derived into
                  slope, aspect and slope position, (3) per- pixel
                  estimates of percent imperviousness and percent tree
                  canopy, (4) 29 classes of land cover data derived
                  from the im- agery, ancillary data, and derivatives,
                  (5) classification rules, confidence estimates, and
                  metadata from the land cover clas- sification. This
                  database is now being developed using a Map- ping
                  Zone approach, with 66 Zones in the continental
                  United States and 23 Zones in Alaska. Results from
                  three initial mapping Zones show single-pixel land
                  cover accuracies ranging from 73 to 77 percent,
                  imperviousness accuracies ranging from 83 to 91
                  percent, tree canopy accuracies ranging from 78 to
                  93 percent, and an estimated 50 percent increase in
                  mapping efficiency over previous methods. The
                  database has now entered the production phase and is
                  being created using extensive partnering in the
                  Federal government with planned completion by 2006.},

                  provide the bulk of the food and fiber essential to
                  human well-being. Most global land cover data sets
                  from satellites group croplands into just a few
                  categories, thereby excluding information that is
                  critical for answering key questions ranging from
                  biodiversity conservation to food security to
                  biogeochemical cycling. Information about
                  agricultural land use practices like crop selection,
                  yield, and fertilizer use is even more limited. Here
                  we present land use data sets created by combining
                  national, state, and county level census statistics

                  and yield of 175 distinct crops of the world. We

  abstract =     {Human activities have shaped significantly the state
                  of terrestrial ecosystems throughout the world. One
                  of the most direct manifestations of human activity
                  within the biosphere has been the conversion of
                  natural ecosystems to croplands. In this study, we
                  present an analysis of the geographic distribution
                  and spatial extent of permanent croplands. This
                  analysis represents the area in permanent croplands
                  during the early 1990s for each grid cell on a
                  global 5 min (∼10 km) resolution latitude-longitude
                  grid. To create this data set, we have combined a
                  satellite-derived land cover data set with a variety
                  of national and subnational agricultural inventory
                  data. A simple calibration algorithm was used so
                  that the spatial land cover data were generally
                  consistent with nonspatial agricultural inventory
                  data. The spatial distribution of croplands
                  represented in this analysis presents a quantitative
                  depiction of global agricultural geography. The
                  regions of the world known to have intense
                  cultivation (e.g., the North American corn belt, the
                  European wheat-corn belt, the Ganges floodplain, and
                  eastern China) are clearly portrayed in this
                  analysis. It also captures the less intensely
                  cultivated regions of the world, usually surrounding
                  the regions mentioned above, and regions
                  characterized by subsistence agriculture (e.g.,
                  Sahelian Africa). Data generated from this kind of
                  analysis can be used within global climate models
                  and global ecosystem models to assess the importance
                  of permanent croplands on environmental
                  processes. In particular, these data, combined with
                  models, could help evaluate the role of changing
                  land cover on regional climate and carbon
                  cycling. Future efforts will need to concentrate on
                  other land use systems, including pastures and
                  regions of shifting cultivation. Furthermore, land
                  use and land cover data must be extended to include
                  an historical dimension so as to evaluate the
                  changing state of the biosphere over time.},

                  used to train a land cover classification data set
                  obtained by merging two different satellite-derived
                  products (Boston University’s MODIS-derived land

                  the end of the last millennium using multiple
                  satellite sensor, secondary, Google Earth, and
                  Groundtruth data. The data included: (a) Advanced
                  Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) 3-band and
                  Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) 10-km
                  monthly time-series for 1997- 1999, (b) Syst\`{e}me

                  NDVI 1-km monthly time series for 1999, (c) East
                  Anglia University Climate Research Unit (CRU)
                  rainfall 50-km monthly time series for 1961-2000,
                  (d) Global 30 Arc-Second Elevation Data Set
                  (GTOPO30) 1-km digital elevation data of the world,
                  (e) Japanese Earth Resources Satellite-1 Synthetic
                  Aperture Radar (JERS-1 SAR) data for the rain
                  forests during two seasons in 1996, and (f)
                  University of Maryland Global Tree Cover 1-km data
                  for 1992-93. A single mega-file data-cube (MFDC) of
                  the world with 159 layers, akin to hyperspectral
                  data, was composed by re-sampling different data
                  types into a common 1- kilometer resolution. The
                  MFDC was segmented based on elevation, temperature,
                  and precipitation zones. Classification was
                  performed on the segments. Quantitative spectral
                  matching techniques (SMTs) used in hyperspectral
                  data analysis were adopted to group class spectra
                  derived from unsupervised classification and match
                  the same with ideal or target spectra. A rigorous
                  class identification and labeling process involved
                  the use of: (a) space time spiral curve (ST-SCs)
                  plots, (b) brightness-greenness- wetness (BGW)
                  plots, (c) time series NDVI plots, (d) Google Earth
                  very high resolution imagery (VHRI) ‚Äúzoon in
                  views‚Äù in over 11,000 locations, (e) groundtruth
                  data broadly sourced from the degree confluence
                  project (3,864 sample locations) and from the GIAM
                  project (1,790 sample locations), (f)
                  high-resolution Landsat-ETM+ Geocover 150-meter
                  mosaic of the world, and (g) secondary data (e.g.,
                  national and global land use and land cover
                  data). Mixed classes were resolved based on decision
                  tree algorithms and spatial modeling and when that
                  did not work the problem class was used to mask
                  MFDC, re- classified, and the class identification
                  and labeling protocol repeated. The sub-pixel area
                  (SPA) calculations were performed by multiplying
                  full pixel areas (FPAs) with irrigated area
                  fractions (IAFs) for every class. A 28-class global
                  irrigated area map (GIAM) was produced and the area
                  statistics reported as: (a) annualized irrigated
                  areas (AIA) which considers intensity of irrigation
                  (i.e., sum of irrigated areas in different seasons
                  plus continuous year-round irrigation), and (b)
                  total area available for irrigation (TAAI), which
                  does not consider intensity of irrigation (i.e.,
                  irrigated areas at any given point of time plus the
                  areas left fallow but ‚Äúequipped for irrigation‚Äù
                  at the same point of time). The AIA of the world at
                  the end of the last millennium was 467 Mha (million
                  hectares), of which there were: (a) 252 Mha from
                  season one, (b) 174 Mha from season two, and (c) 41
                  Mha from continuous year- round crops. The TAAI at
                  the end of last millennium was 399 Mha. The
                  distribution of irrigated areas is highly skewed
                  amongst continents and countries. Asia accounts for
                  79 percent (370 Mha) of all annualized irrigated
                  areas, followed by Europe (7\%) and North America
                  (7\%). Three continents, South America (4\%), Africa
                  (2\%), and Australia (1\%), have a very low
                  proportion of the global irrigation. China and India
                  are the two leading irrigated area countries with a
                  combined total of nearly 62 percent of the global
                  AIAs, mainly as a result of cropping during multiple
                  seasons. Of this, China has 32.5 percent (152 Mha)
                  of the global AIAs and India has 28.3 percent (132
                  Mha) of the AIAs. This is followed by USA (5.2\%),
                  Pakistan (3.4\%) and Russia (2.4\%). Eight other
                  countries (Argentina, Thailand, Bangladesh,
                  Kazakhstan, Myanmar, Australia, Uzbekistan and
                  Vietnam) have areas between 1 and 2 percent and four
                  others (Brazil, Mexico, Indonesia and Egypt) between
                  0.7 and 1 percent. All other countries have less
                  than 0.7 percent of the global AIAs. The TAAI for
                  China is 112 Mha and for India 101 Mha. The GIAM had
                  an accuracy of 79-91 percent with errors of omission
                  not exceeding 21 percent and the errors of
                  commission not exceeding 23 percent. The GIAM
                  products are made available through a web portal
                  (http://www.iwmigiam.org).},

@article{YouWood2006,
  abstract =	 {While agricultural production statistics are
                  reported on a geopolitical ‚Äì often national ‚Äì
                  basis we often need to know the status of production
                  or productivity within specific sub- regions,
                  watersheds, or agroecological zones. Such
                  re-aggregations are typically made using expert
                  judgments or simple area-weighting rules. We
                  describe a new, entropy-based approach to making
                  spatially disaggregated assessments of the
                  distribution of crop production. Using this
                  approach, tabular crop production statistics are
                  blended judiciously with an array of other secondary
                  data to assess the production of specific crops
                  within individual ‚Äòpixels‚Äô ‚Äì typically
                  25‚Äì100 square kilometers in size. The information
                  utilized includes crop production statistics,
                  farming system characteristics, satellite-derived
                  land cover data, biophysical crop suitability
                  assessments, and population density. An application
                  is presented in which Brazilian state level
                  production statistics are used to generate pixel
                  level crop production data for eight crops. To
                  validate the spatial allocation we aggregated the
                  pixel estimates to obtain synthetic estimates of
                  municipality level production in Brazil, and
                  compared those estimates with actual munici- pality
                  statistics. The approach produced extremely
                  promising results. We then examined the robustness
                  of these results compared to short-cut approaches to
                  allocating crop production statistics and showed
                  that, while computationally intensive, the
                  cross-entropy method does provide more reliable
                  estimates of crop production patterns.},
