\begin{abstract} This paper presents an effort to produce a new land
  cover data set for the conterminous United States that augments
  available agricultural land use data with other uses and covers to
  create a complete landscape characterization.  We start with the data
  set described in Ramankutty, et al., 2008, which improves on the
  spatial distributions of agricultural land indicated by the MODIS Land
  Cover Type and Global Land Cover 2000 data products on which it is
  based by incorporating agricultural census data as a ground truth
  constraint.  However, it provides no information regarding areas which
  were judged to have been misclassified.  We present a method for
  reconciling the Ramankutty data with the MODIS Land Cover Type map for
  2001 and aspects of the higher-resolution 2001 National Landcover
  Database.  This result is subsequently merged with the data from
  Monfreda, et al., 2008 in order to further disaggregate cropland into
  commodity sub-classes.  We describe a prototype economic land use
  change model driven by land conversion costs, crop yield expectations,
  and climate change scenarios that requires this data for
  initialization.  We examine trends in other data sets to assess the
  accuracy of change in agricultural land area expressed in the MODIS
  time series after 2001.  This effort points a way forward to the
  eventual production of a global, annual time series of land cover/
  land use maps featuring explicit disaggregation of croplands by
  commodity to be used in economic modeling of global agricultural
  production, trade, and consumption.
