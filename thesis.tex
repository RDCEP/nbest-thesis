\begin{abstract} This paper presents an effort to produce a new land
  cover data set for the conterminous United States of America (cUSA)
  that augments available agricultural land use data with other uses
  and natual covers to create a complete landscape characterization.
  Using the Agland2000 data set as a benchmark we formulate a
  hybridization of the MODIS Land Cover Type (MLCT) for 2001 and the
  2001 National Land Cover Database (NLCD) that is particularly
  tailored to serve as an initialization data set for long-term
  economic land use change models.  In order strike a balance between
  spatial precision and local diversity of use and cover the new data
  set has lower resolution than the MLCT (5$'$ vs. 500m) but
  represents consituent cover classes as sub-pixel fractions rather
  than discrete categories.  After aggregating to the 5$'$ grid we
  present a method for decomposing the natural vegetaion/cropland
  mosaic class found in MLCT into constituent classes as a function of
  the local landscape and quantify its contribution to aggregate
  acreages by class, particularly cropland.  We compensate for the
  absence of certain fine-grained details from MLCT, such as rural
  transportation networks, small settlements, linear water features,
  and wetlands, mainly due to sensor resolution, by incorporating
  corresponding components of the NLCD, after similar reclassification
  and aggregation, as a set of offsets to the MLCT-derived fractions.
  The 175Crops2000 data set, valuable for its basis in per-crop
  agricultural production statistics, is used as a guide to further
  decompose the cropland areas into a set of crop-specific
  sub-categories designed to facilitate the economic modeling goals of
  the simulations that will be initialized by this data product.  The
  final classification scheme, now conceptually equivalent to a stack
  of spectral bands with the additional quality that the components of
  each pixel sum to unity, is a mixture of a simplified version of the
  IGBP schema used in MLCT and a disaggregation of the monolithic
  cropland class that differentiates among the world's major commodity
  crops. \todo{It remains to be seen how well the disaggregation of
    commodities will work. We may have to leave it out.}  At each step
  of refinement we show that overall spatial distribution of cropland
  across the study area improves relative to the Aglands2000 data set.
  We close with a discussion of how this method might be applied
  globally and to successive years in the MLCT time series.

\chapter{Conclusions}
\label{cha:conclusions}

The goal of this study was to produce a LULC data set that was as
accurate as possible with respect to its representation of the
distribution of agricultural production and that also offers a
reasonable characterization of non-crop covers and land use beyond
those agricultural uses.  We have accomplished that.  In doing so we
have adopted a sub-pixel data structure for conveying land use and
land cover information, albeit at a low spatial resolution by today's
remote sensing and GIS standards.  However, we hope that our readers
will consider that this data structure has particular mathematical
properties that may make it useful for their applications.  The
ability to perform raster algebra on these stacks of maps made it
possible to apply scaling factors and offsets with concise syntax in
the \texttt{R} language that would not have been feasible in a
discrete, categorical framework.

We maintain that the reproducible research aspect of this study was
critical to its success.  By elaborating the analysis in an
interactive environment where every component of every data structure
is subject to inspection many missteps were discovered in the course
of our work.  In other GIS analysis environments it might have been
too difficult to perform basic sanity checks on intermediate outputs
before moving on and too easy to rely on a sense of ``everything looks
right'' in a GUI environment.  The ability to point to a body of
source code that expresses the steps of the analysis is a poignant
example of reproducibility, a pillar of the scientific method that has
fallen out of vogue because of the complexity of modern spatial
analysis until the recent emergence of applicable software tools
coupled with adequate computing resources.

Future directions of investigation:

Model \% cultivation of MLCT cropland and mosaic pixels as function of classification
confidence and secondary class, for example, in order to make original
MLCT data more useful for direct analysis of agricultural activity using
its native resolution and classification.

Model \% urban as a function of population density, agricultural
productivity, and other economic productivity to develop a proxy for
the low-density values derived from NLCD in order to extend this
method globally.

Comparison of this data to other available LULC characterizations,
particularly the Major Land Use (MLU) data and the Cropland Data Layer
(CDL) from the USDA, would provide useful validation metrics.
