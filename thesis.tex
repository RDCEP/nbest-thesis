\begin{abstract} This paper presents an effort to produce a new land
cover data set for the conterminous United States that augments
available agricultural land use data with other uses and covers to
create a complete landscape characterization.  We start with the data
set described in Ramankutty, et al., 2008, which improves on the
spatial distributions of agricultural land indicated by the MODIS Land
Cover Type and Global Land Cover 2000 data products on which it is
based by incorporating agricultural census data as a ground truth
constraint.  However, it provides no information regarding areas which
were judged to have been misclassified.  We present a method for
reconciling the Ramankutty data with the MODIS Land Cover Type map for
2001 and aspects of the higher-resolution 2001 National Landcover
Database.  This result is subsequently merged with the data from
Monfreda, et al., 2008 in order to further disaggregate cropland into
commodity sub-classes.  We describe a prototype economic land use
change model driven by land conversion costs, crop yield expectations,
and climate change scenarios that requires this data for
initialization.  We examine trends in other data sets to assess the
accuracy of change in agricultural land area expressed in the MODIS
time series after 2001.  This effort points a way forward to the
eventual production of a global, annual time series of land cover/
land use maps featuring explicit disaggregation of croplands by
commodity to be used in economic modeling of global agricultural
production, trade, and consumption.
