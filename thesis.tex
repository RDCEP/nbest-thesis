\begin{abstract} This paper presents an effort to produce a new land
  cover data set for the conterminous United States that augments
  available agricultural land use data with other uses and covers to
  create a complete landscape characterization.  We start with the data
  set described in Ramankutty, et al., 2008, which improves on the
  spatial distributions of agricultural land indicated by the MODIS Land
  Cover Type and Global Land Cover 2000 data products on which it is
  based by incorporating agricultural census data as a ground truth
  constraint.  However, it provides no information regarding areas which
  were judged to have been misclassified.  We present a method for
  reconciling the Ramankutty data with the MODIS Land Cover Type map for
  2001 and aspects of the higher-resolution 2001 National Landcover
  Database.  This result is subsequently merged with the data from
  Monfreda, et al., 2008 in order to further disaggregate cropland into
  commodity sub-classes.  We describe a prototype economic land use
  change model driven by land conversion costs, crop yield expectations,
  and climate change scenarios that requires this data for
  initialization.  We examine trends in other data sets to assess the
  accuracy of change in agricultural land area expressed in the MODIS
  time series after 2001.  This effort points a way forward to the
  eventual production of a global, annual time series of land cover/
  land use maps featuring explicit disaggregation of croplands by
  commodity to be used in economic modeling of global agricultural
  production, trade, and consumption.

This thesis is dedicated to my son, Leo.  Son, I began working on this
degree before you were born and my commitment to completing it was
sustained by my desire to demonstrate to you that in life we finish
what we have started.

I could not have completed this paper over the past year and, by
extension, my degree over more years than I care to mention without the
support of my loving wife, Laura.

This work was made possible through the support of my
employer, the Computation Institute at the University of Chicago, and its
director, Dr. Ian Foster.  

My thesis committee was comprised of Dr. Monika Mihir (chair),
Dr. Erick Howenstine (department head), both of the Department of
Geography \& Environmental Studies at Northeastern Illinois
University, and Dr. Joshua Elliott from the Computation Institute.  I
deeply appreciate their guidance and support through all stages of
this phase of my education.
