\begin{abstract} This paper presents an effort to produce a new land
  cover data set for the conterminous United States of America (cUSA)
  that augments available agricultural land use data with other uses
  and natual covers to create a complete landscape characterization.
  Using the Agland2000 data set as a benchmark we formulate a
  hybridization of the MODIS Land Cover Type (MLCT) for 2001 and the
  2001 National Land Cover Database (NLCD) that is particularly
  tailored to serve as an initialization data set for long-term
  economic land use change models.  In order strike a balance between
  spatial precision and local diversity of use and cover the new data
  set has lower resolution than the MLCT (5$'$ vs. 500m) but
  represents consituent cover classes as sub-pixel fractions rather
  than discrete categories.  After aggregating to the 5$'$ grid we
  present a method for decomposing the natural vegetaion/cropland
  mosaic class found in MLCT into constituent classes as a function of
  the local landscape and quantify its contribution to aggregate
  acreages by class, particularly cropland.  We compensate for the
  absence of certain fine-grained details from MLCT, such as rural
  transportation networks, small settlements, linear water features,
  and wetlands, mainly due to sensor resolution, by incorporating
  corresponding components of the NLCD, after similar reclassification
  and aggregation, as a set of offsets to the MLCT-derived fractions.
  The 175Crops2000 data set, valuable for its basis in per-crop
  agricultural production statistics, is used as a guide to further
  decompose the cropland areas into a set of crop-specific
  sub-categories designed to facilitate the economic modeling goals of
  the simulations that will be initialized by this data product.  The
  final classification scheme, now conceptually equivalent to a stack
  of spectral bands with the additional quality that the components of
  each pixel sum to unity, is a mixture of a simplified version of the
  IGBP schema used in MLCT and a disaggregation of the monolithic
  cropland class that differentiates among the world's major commodity
  crops. \todo{It remains to be seen how well the disaggregation of
    commodities will work. We may have to leave it out.}  At each step
  of refinement we show that overall spatial distribution of cropland
  across the study area improves relative to the Aglands2000 data set.
  We close with a discussion of how this method might be applied
  globally and to successive years in the MLCT time series.

\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

\noindent This thesis is dedicated to my son, Leo.  Son, I began
working on this degree before you were born and my commitment to
completing it was sustained by my desire to demonstrate to you that in
life we finish what we have started.

\noindent I could not have completed this paper over the past year
and, by extension, my degree over more years than I care to mention
without the support of my loving wife, Laura.

\noindent I want to thank Dr. Nicholas Kouchoukos of Lanworth,
Inc. for throwing me in the deep end of applying the open-source
geospatial software tool chain to spatial analysis of agriculture.

its director, Dr. Ian Foster under the Community Integrated Model of
Economic and Resource Trajectories for Humankind project (CIM-EARTH,

Department of Geography \& Environmental Studies at Northeastern
Illinois University, and Dr. Joshua Elliott from the Computation
Institute.  I deeply appreciate their guidance and support through all
stages of this project.
